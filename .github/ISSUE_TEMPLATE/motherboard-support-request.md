Please include the following material or your issue will be closed:
 - **Full name of Motherboard** - LHM should identify the motherboard properly, but if not, HWMonitor might be able to. When dealing with MSI motherboards, the full name should appear similar to the following: `MAG X870 TOMAHAWK WIFI (MS-7E51)` Note the trailing model number in parenthesis. It is imperative that this information be accurate, as our current solution relies on properly identifying the motherboard. 
- **LibreHardwareMonitor Report** - This can be generated by going to File > Save Report in LibreHardwareMonitor. If you'd like to sensor the data within, please make sure you _only_ include data in the "Hardware Monitor Registers" section of the report. This section is terminated by a long series of hyphens.
